👩‍💻 **Hi, I'm Mrunmayi!**  
Bridging the gap between *if* and *else* since the day I learned to code.

🚀 B.Tech IT @ VJTI | Android & Web Dev Enthusiast  
Currently building cool stuff with Java, Python, HTML, and a cup of coffee ☕.

🛠️ I break things just to fix them better.  
Sometimes I write code that works. Sometimes I stare at semicolons until they behave.

🌐 Love turning caffeine into full-stack magic — from buttons that actually work to apps that don't crash (usually).  

📸 When I'm not coding, I'm busy chasing sunsets, shooting photos, and pretending to be a book critic.
